    "description": "Create a threat model for the liquidation flow of the Spook protocol. A liquidation happens when the collateral value falls below a particular threshold as a percentage of the borrowed assets. E.g. lets assume the collateral requirement is 110%. If you borrow $100K and deposit 100 ETH as collateral (current value of approx $120K), the ETH needs to have at least a value of $110K. Once the value falls below $110K, the position gets liquidated (aka sold) and the user can keep the borrowed asset. In the process, a user would loose $10K."
